# Deep learning

# Task 0: Deep learning Matlab
Deep learning in ten lines is an example provided by the mat lab to get acquainted to the work.This
example uses alexnet network as an example.Alexnet is a pretrained CNN which can classify objects into
1000 categories.

# Task 1: Use pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (convNet or CNN)
A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an
input image, assign importance (learn able weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and
be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as
compared to other classification algorithms. While in primitive methods filters are hand-engineered, with
enough training, ConvNets have the ability to learn these filters/characteristics

# Task 2: Transfer learning via feature extraction
In deep learning, transfer learning is a technique whereby a neural network model is first trained on
a problem similar to the problem that is being solved. One or more layers from the trained model are
then used in a new model trained on the problem of interest.This is typically understood in a supervised
learning context, where the input is the same but the target may be of a different nature. For example, we
may learn about one set of visual categories, such as cats and dogs, in the first setting, then learn about a
different set of visual categories, such as ants and wasps, in the second setting.

# Task 3: Transfer learning via retraining
This experiment is as follows : Use an existing network as the initialization for a new training.The
pretrained networks takes an image as input, and then outputs a label for the object in the image together
with the probabilities for each of the object categories.A pretrained network can be used as a starting point
to learn a new task. Fine-tuning a network with transfer learning is usually much faster and easier than
training a network from scratch with randomly initialized weights.
